## Exam Resources

- Candidate Information Bulletin: [Download PDF](https://www.tsbpe.texas.gov/exams/bulletin.pdf)

### Study Materials (Recommended)

2. **2024 International Plumbing Code** (required reference)
3. **Texas Administrative Code** Title 30, Part 1, Chapter 365

### What Actually Matters
- **Code questions dominate**: 60% of exam is code interpretation
- **Know fixture unit calculations cold** - they will test this multiple ways
- **Venting questions trip people up** - understand the tables, don't memorize
- **Have your code book tabbed** - you can use it during the exam
- Most failures happen because people don't practice with the actual code book

## Field Notes / Gotchas

### Common Pitfalls
- **Documentation is everything**: Keep detailed hour logs from day one
- **The 4-year rule**: Experience must be within 7 years of application
- **Municipal permits separate**: Your state license doesn't automatically let you pull permits
- **Backflow certification**: Not included in plumber license - separate TCEQ certification required

### What Inspectors Actually Care About
- Proper venting (always)
- Water heater TPR valve discharge termination (catches people every time)
- Expansion tanks on water heaters - required statewide as of 2012
- Fixture spacing per code - minimum distances from walls/other fixtures
